This code is mainly taken from the authors of the two reference papers we tried to replicate. 
Luciani and Barigozzi created the code in the "code BL" folder. Morley and Wong created the code in "code MW".

The reason this code is uploaded is to allow replication of the machine learning project hereby presented.
Some minor modifications were made to the code in order to make it compatible with our specific application.
